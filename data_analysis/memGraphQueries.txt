Display a subset of the network with nodes and their edges.
```
// 1. Match nodes and their relationships
MATCH (n)-[r]-(m)
WITH n, r, m
LIMIT 100

// 2. Return both nodes AND relationships with styling
RETURN n, r, m,
{

    WHEN n.platform = 'Facebook' THEN '#3b5998'
    WHEN n.platform = 'Twitter' THEN '#1DA1F2'

MATCH (n)-[r]-()
WITH n, count(r) AS degree
WHERE degree <= 30
RETURN n.user_id;
